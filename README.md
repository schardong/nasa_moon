# GALGOS Moon

This project is an attempt to build upon NASA's provided datasets to plan a rover mission to find water on the Moon's south pole.


## Introduction

In $2009$, an Indian Space Program probe found evidence of water on the Moon's south pole. Water is an important element for the establishment of a more permanent settlement, since it is necessary for survival, energy generation, etc.

To this date, there were several works published aiming to estimate locations where water could be found based on spectroscopy data collected from flybys. There are basically three ''sources`` of water for the Moon: (i) Asteroids; (ii) Solar winds; finally (iii) Moon's interior.

It has ben hypothesized that the Moon's poles may contain increased ammounts of ice water, since they are not exposed to the Sun's heat. This hypothesis is backed by Moon Mineralogy Mapper [1] data
